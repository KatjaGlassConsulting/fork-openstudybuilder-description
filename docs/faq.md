# FAQ

Questions which are not answered in the corresponding documentation section will be answered here. Looking for a different answer? Please address your question in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/openstudybuilder/shared_invite/zt-15wjahh1c-4Tf41VseN3j_f76qjHWt3g){target=_blank}.

## Confidentiality

The OpenStudyBuilder project is an open source project and information should be broadly available for everyone. When you post information via Slack, GitLab Issues and similar, these will publicy be available and visible by many people. 

Of course there might be confidential information which should not be shared publicly. If you want to share confidential information with the core project team, like a concrete plan to join the project as company, please use the community mail address (OpenStudyBuilder@gmail.com). These mails will be handled confidentially. In the beginning only the community manager (Katja Glass) and the main sponsor (colleagues from Novo Nordisk) will see these mails.
