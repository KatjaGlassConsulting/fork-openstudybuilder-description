# Environments

## Pre-Requisites

The current implementation required CDISC library access to access CDISC standards (freely available also for non-CDISC-members), a Neo4j database license for the database (a community version is available) and a set of servers where the web applications and API services can run.

Access to the open-source code will be via a public accessible GitLab repository. A link to this repository will be provided when available.

Access to a cloud-based or a dedicated evaluation environment can be provided by Neo4j free of charge. Please check the following section for more information.

It is also possible to run the full system on a **local desktop environment** or on an individual cloud subscription on any of the main cloud providers. Instructions on how to set up the system on a local desktop can be found in the readme files of the individual components. The different components can also be used independently due to the modular implementation and API usages.

## Cloud evaluation environments

To evaluate the OpenStudyBuilder, Neo4j can provide you with an evaluation environment in different flavors, cloud-based and leveraging AuraDB.

This environment can be provided to you in different ways:

Type | Access | Complete initial dataset | Custom data | Usable for production | Pricing
--|--|--|--|--|--
Sandbox | Public | No | No - creating elements is possible, but this environment will be refreshed periodically | No | Free
Custom sandbox | Restricted | Optionally | Yes | No | Free - Limited time
Dedicated | Restricted | Yes | Yes | Optionally | See contact details below

All of the above can be made available in a modular fashion, for instance:

1. Neo4j AuraDB database + OpenStudyBuilder App and API
2. Neo4j AuraDB database + OpenStudyBuilder API (build your own Study Builder app on top of it)
3. Neo4j AuraDB database only (for exploration purposes)

Please note that Neo4j AuraDB exists in 3 flavors :

1. Free - Free forever, with limited number of nodes and relationships
2. Pro - Pay as you go, for medium scale applications
3. Enterprise - Advanced security and support
