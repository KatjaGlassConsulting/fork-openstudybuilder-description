**Revolutionizing Clinical Trials: The Impact of OpenStudyBuilder on Automation and Insights**

by Katja Gla&szlig;, Katja Glass Consutling

OpenStudyBuilder, an open-source metadata and study definition repository, is revolutionizing the landscape of clinical trials by enabling end-to-end automation, from protocol generation to report creation. This presentation will provide an in-depth exploration of the current capabilities of OpenStudyBuilder, with a focus on its available and upcoming downstream tools. These include a Word add-in for protocol generation, standard utilities such as an R package for study and standard metadata download, and integrations with EDC and ePRO systems. Additionally, we will delve into how dashboards can offer insightful knowledge.
