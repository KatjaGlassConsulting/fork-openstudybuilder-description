## COSA Biomedical Concept & OpenStudyBuilder Workshop (Copenhagen, Denmark)

(25 April 2023, Copenhagen, 9:00-15:00)

At this workshop we will dive into what Biomedical Concepts (BC) is, and how the can be applied within a MDR data standards repository and a SDR study definitions repository – illustrated within the OpenStudyBuilder (OSB) solution.

We will as well relate to how BC’s are defined within COSMoS, DDF, d4k and other models. There will be a shared introduction followed by 4 breakout sessions, leading to a shared reflection and discussion on how we can support and bring these initiatives forward. The 4 breakout sessions are currently defined as:

- Setup BC’s in OSB SoA for a new study, run various queries to learn how BC’s can be utilised
- Learn and understand the BC model in OSB versus the COSMoS, DDF, d4k and other models
- Create and curate OSB BC content via the OSB Library and NeoDash reports
- Mining BC’s from existing data sources like SDTM
