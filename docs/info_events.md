## PHUSE SDE - Heidelberg, Germany

(22 June 2023, live event in Copenhagen)

**OpenStudyBuilder - Experimentation Examples**

by Katja Glass, Katja Glass Consulting

The OpenStudyBuilder is a versatile open-source solution that serves as both a clinical metadata repository (MDR) and study definition repository (SDR). Developed as part of the CDISC 360 project, it is fully compliant with COSMoS and Digital Data Flow (DDF) standards, making it a powerful tool for managing clinical trial data.

This presentation offers a deep dive into the features of OpenStudyBuilder, highlighting how it streamlines processes related to study setup, protocol automation, and CRF development, as well as managing standards. We will demonstrate how you can leverage OpenStudyBuilder to explore dashboards based on biomedical concepts, export information in DDF format, automate protocol creation, and much more. You can gain valuable insights and inspiration on how you can benefit and collaborate!
