## PHUSE SDE - Heidelberg, Germany

(27 June 2024)

**Revolutionizing Clinical Trials: The Impact of OpenStudyBuilder on Automation and Insights**

by Katja Gla&szlig;, Katja Glass Consutling

OpenStudyBuilder, an open-source metadata and study definition repository, is revolutionizing the landscape of clinical trials by enabling end-to-end automation, from protocol generation to report creation. This presentation will provide an in-depth exploration of the current capabilities of OpenStudyBuilder, with a focus on its available and upcoming downstream tools. These include a Word add-in for protocol generation, standard utilities such as an R package for study and standard metadata download, and integrations with EDC and ePRO systems. Additionally, we will delve into how dashboards can offer insightful knowledge.

## PHUSE SDE - Copenhagen, Denmark

(10 October 2024)

We plan to submit an abstract for the PHUSE SDE Copenhagen in Denmark. There will be OpenStudyBuilder representatives at the event.

## CDISC US Interchange

(23-24 October 2024 - Phoenix/Scottsdale, US)

We will be at the CDISC Interchange with a presentation and are also planning for a workshop (planning ongoing).

**Schedule of Activities in OpenStudyBuilder**

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk

This presentation demonstrate how OpenStudyBuilder operates across various standard levels to define the Schedule of Activities (SoA) as part of a structured study specification, catering to distinct study purposes: 

- **Protocol SoA:** High level SoA in protocol, main purpose is for the investigator and site staff to get an overview of the operational schedule. 
- **Detailed SoA:** Specifying the semantic data observations to be collected in the study – but not specific to representation in ADaM, SDTM or data collection; Will be part of protocol and appendixes or other supplementary documents. 
- **Operational SoA:** Data specification to support data collection specification; Will also be related to specific ADaM PARAM/PARAMCD for collected data and thereby used to specify the data needed for analysis. 
- **Data Capture / Collection Specification:** EDC information related to the SoA – i.e., how data is to be collected in the study and when, what is pre-set, what is collected and how. 

The Schedule of Activities at the different levels are a major result when working with biomedical concepts and for this is integrated in the data model linked to the corresponding biomedical concept definitions in OpenStudyBuilder library module. This way and end-to-end connectivity and study setup automation is enabled. 

The OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome from the CDISC 360 project and shared as open source under COSA aiming for end-to-end automations from protocol to TLFs. The solution consists of a Study Builder Application connected to a Metadata Repository holding data standards and a Study Definition Repository with study specifications. 

## PHUSE EU Connect

(10-13 November 2024 - Strasbourg, France)

We will be at the PhUSE EU Connect. Please come to the Novo Nordisk or CDISC Open Source Alliance booth to catch up with us. We are also happy to participate in the following events:

**Poster - Status and news in OpenStudyBuilder**

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk

The OpenStudyBuilder is an open-source project for clinical study specifications. This tool is a new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities and public disclosure of study information.This poster will present our current status and capabilities added to StudyBuilder this year. 

**Presentation - Leveraging the USDM Standard in OpenStudyBuilder for Enhanced Data Exchange**

by Marius Conjeaud, Neo4j and Nicolas de Saint Jorre, Novo Nordisk

Explore the integration of the Unified Study Data Model (USDM) in OpenStudyBuilder, an open- source metadata and study definition repository. Developed by CDISC, USDM aims to streamline the exchange of study definitions and enable end-to-end automation across multiple systems. OpenStudyBuilder supports these processes and facilitates system integrations with its open interfaces and native graph-based data model. Beyond its native exports, OpenStudyBuilder also offers a study export in USDM format as a JSON file, enhancing connectivity with other USDM-compliant systems. This presentation delves into the data collection and transformation process, the challenges encountered, and the opportunities presented by this innovative standard. 

**Related Presentation - Digital Data Flow: Achieving Protocol Digitalization and Clinical Research Interoperability through Multi-stakeholder Collaboration**

by William Illis and Lakshmi Sankar,TransCelerate

Digitalizing clinical protocol information can streamline study start-up, enable analytics-assisted study design and feasibility, and support more routine use of point-of-care data for research. Digital Data Flow (DDF) has supported the CDISC efforts to develop a foundational data model, the Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM), and has developed an open-source reference implementation, the Study Definitions Repository (SDR) to digitalize the clinical protocol and achieve interoperability between clinical trial systems.This session focuses on how industry stakeholders can make real the application of DDF for clinical protocol digitalization for your organization. The presentation will sit alongside presentations, "ICH M11 Clinical electronic Structure Harmonized Protocol (CeSHarP) and CDISC: Making the Electronic Protocol a reality" and "The TransCelerate / CDISC Digital Data Flow Project: Practical Electronic Study Designs" to set the stage on how the DDF project and the ICH M11 work will come together in the future as an important industry initiative.  

## BVMA (German Organization)

(22 November 2024 - Munic, Germany)

Katja will speak at the German organization "Bundesverband Medizinischer Auftragsinstitute e.V." about an introduction to the OpenStudyBuilder, and the oppotunities it provides as an open source project.
