## DMB Annual Conference

(21 November 2023, live event in Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris, France)

**The OpenStudyBuilder as a new Metadata Repository solution**

by Nicolas de Saint Jorre, Novo Nordisk

DMB - Association Française de Data Management Biomédical

The OpenStudyBuilder is an open source project for clinical study evaluations. This tool is a
new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end
consistency and more efficient processes – all the way from protocol development and CRF
design – to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities, and
public disclosure of study information. Learn how we are building a complete solution based
on a clinical knowledge graph that includes a shared API, a custom web application, and
exploration tools to further analyze the data. We will also share the open source vision
behind the project and how you can help! The OpenStudyBuilder, originally created by Novo
Nordisk, a global healthcare company, uses Neo4j as its database, along with other products
from the Neo4j ecosystem, including NeoDash, Bloom, and the neomodel Python library.
Neo4j's professional services team is also involved in the development and deployment of
the solution.
