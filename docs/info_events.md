**Concept-based standards in OpenStudyBuilder supporting structured protocol content and submission deliverables**

(27th October 2022 - Session 5: Track B - Trial Design - 8:30 - 9:00CT)

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S

OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome of the CDISC 360 project and as a Digital Data Flow (DDF) compliant solution. The vision is to make metadata driven study specifications based on concept-based standards to be applied in protocol development, downstream system setup and SDTM submission deliverables.

The solution includes an MDR component for managing versioned external and sponsor-defined data standards as concept based end-to-end standards linked from protocol specification, data collection to submission datasets. This presentation will focus on how we define and apply the concept based data standards.

OpenStudyBuilder is currently being developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with vendors. Our ambition is to share the solution as open source under COSA and thereby contribute to improvement of tools supporting digitalisation in clinical development.  

**CDISC Open Source Alliance Booth / COSA Booth**

Watch out for demonstrations of the OpenStudyBuilder and come around to ask questions and learn more! Among other tools and topics which are presented and talked about at the COSA booth, also the OpenStudyBuilder is on board!

## PHUSE EU Connect (Belfast)

(13-16 November 2022, live event in Belfast)

**Vision and demonstration of the OpenStudyBuilder for supporting structured protocol content and submission deliverables using concept-based standards**

by Martin Gram and Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S

OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome of the CDISC 360 project and as a Digital Data Flow (DDF) compliant solution. The vision is to make metadata driven study specifications based on concept-based standards to be applied in protocol development, downstream system setup and SDTM submission deliverables. It includes an MDR component for managing versioned external and sponsor-defined data standards. 

This presentation will demonstrate the solution by:

- Showing how concept-based standards can be applied to define a study e.g., specifying objectives, endpoints, activities with reference to the study design schedule.
- Defining SDTM trial summary parameters, study arms, elements, epochs, and visit schedules.Creating structured protocol content directly from the repository.
