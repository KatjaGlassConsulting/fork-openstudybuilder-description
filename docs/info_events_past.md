## PHUSE EMEA Autumn SDE (Copenhagen)

(13 October 2022, live event in Copenhagen)

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S, Katja Glass, Consultant and others

**Presentation: OpenStudyBuilder - Open Source MDR**

The OpenStudyBuilder is based on a proof of concept as part of the CDISC 360° project and is aiming to be a Transcelerate Digital Data Flow compliant implementation aiming for an end-to-end process. Metadata driven concept-based standards can ease our processes and tools. This presentation will show how we can benefit from working with connected metadata with the focus for SDTM and ADAM.

The OpenStudyBuilder is built by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with other vendors. It is (going to be) available as open source. This can become a game changer in our industry, as this will allow for full-scale collaborations that not only discuss processes and tools, but also share implementations, creating flexible and generic toolsets! By using standard APIs, e.g. those from the Transcelerate DDF project, a flexible, generic and interoperable tool landscape can be built.  Just like what we are used to from plug and play apps! 

The MDR as the heart, contains all the metadata and core study data information. The API allows many possible up and down stream integrations enabling system and data integrations. This includes the opportunity to create SAS macros or R functions to download information to the evaluation environments or even upload information.

## DDF Connectathon

(12-30 September 2022, virtual 3-week-event)

**DDF Showcase**

We join the DDF Connectathon with an OpenStudyBuilder show case.

Our OpenStudyBuilder team demonstrated how the OpenStudyBuilder, as a DDF reference implementation, can handle next to DDF USDM also additional data and standards in order to enable end-to-end consistency, automation and support efficient processes from protocol development and CRF design to the creation of data sets. 

The OpenStudyBuilder team covered: 

OpenStudyBuilder Development

- Managing standards: CDISC CT, Dictionary Terms, Concepts & Internal (sponsor standards)

DDF API Adapter

- Utilising Transcelerate SDR/USDM to integrate 
- Other downstream systems can utilize OpenStudyBuilder  API
	
EDC Integration

- Via DDF API adapter
- Via OpenStudyBuilder native API
- Via ODM-XML file with extensions

Demo videos and additional material will be made available here soon (October 2022).

## PHUSE EMEA SDE - Basel

(21 June 2022, live event in Basel)

by Katja Glass, Consultant (Community Manager for OpenStudyBuilder)

**OpenStudyBuilder - The Game Changer**

The OpenStudyBuilder is an open-source project run by NovoNordisk with the intention to support the future CDISC and DDF standards. It can become a game changer to enable the next step of collaboration together with common processes and workflows. Only when we share and discuss also tool implementations including supporting processes, we can build a common toolset and processes which we can use throughout our complete industry. This presentation will show a brief description of the OpenStudyBuilder tool and will show how we as industry can make use of it and design additional processes and tools as building blocks supported by a generic design, specific APIs and the will to change.

## GraphConnect 2022

(6-8 June 2022, live event in Austin, TX, USA)

by Marius CONJEAUD (NEO4J) and Nicolas DE SAINT JORRE (QUANTICSOFT / EVIDENTIQ)

**Creating a Clinical Knowledge Graph: Pharmaceutical Collaboration With OpenStudyBuilder**

OpenStudyBuilder is an open source project for clinical study evaluations. This tool is a new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes – all the way from protocol development and CRF design – to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities, and public disclosure of study information. Learn how we are building a complete solution based on a clinical knowledge graph that includes a shared API, a custom web application, and exploration tools to further analyze the data. We will also share the open source vision behind the project and how you can help! The OpenStudyBuilder, originally created by NovoNordisk, a global healthcare company, uses Neo4j as its database, along with other products from the Neo4j ecosystem, including NeoDash, Bloom, and the neomodel Python library. Neo4j's professional services team is also involved in the development and deployment of the solution.

## Graph Meetup Amsterdam

(12 May 2022, 18:00-20:00, live event in Amsterdam)

by Marius CONJEAUD (NEO4J) and Nicolas DE SAINT JORRE (QUANTICSOFT/ EVIDENTIQ)

**OpenStudyBuilder - "All you wanted to know about <del>Sex</del> Blood Pressure but were afraid to ask?"**

In this presentation we will demo this new OpenStudyBuilder application (in beta mode) starting from a very simple example:
"To demonstrate the superiority of Drug A relative to Drug B on Blood Pressure (BP)". This will lead us into the magic world of Nodes and Relationships to illustrate how this clinical objective can be "translated" into a linked graph, reducing the number of inconsistencies!

This presentation should illustrate how a concrete NEO4J professional application will help Clinical Research to bring a new drug to the market faster. You will see how this Graph database will allow us to produce related and consistent data to improve life on Earth!

## CDISC Open Source Alliance (COSA) OpenStudyBuilder Workshop

(29 April 2022, 9:00 - 13:00 CET)

by many colleagues

*additional resulting material coming soon*

At this workshop the following has been presented ([slides](./presentations/2022-04-09-COSA-Workshop-introduction.pdf){target=_blank}):

- Why you should consider to use the OpenStudyBuilder solution
- Why we share OpenStudyBuilder as an open source project
- Why you should consider to contribute to the OpenStudyBuilder solution
  
Then we split into number of breakout sessions where a facilitator presented a focus area and demonstrate relevant functionalities in the OpenStudyBuilder tool and lead discussions. The group members could try these and then discuss and reflect. The goal for each breakout group had been to present a short overview of their reflections and recommendations within their focus area for everyone, where the outcome will be included soon

The following **breakout groups** had been defined:

- Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for structured protocol content ([slides](./presentations/2022-04-09-COSA-Workshop-breakout1-protocol.pdf){target=_blank})

## Presentation - Next Generation MDR Solution

**Next Generation MDR Solution for Study Design and Configuration Using Concept-based Standards**

*(15-19 November 2021 - PHUSE EU Connect)*

[Recording](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3434982/5FD81FE1D2CC85B2DA504DBBAF23DDE8){target=_blank} (needs EU Connect 2021 registration), [Slides](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3434982/5FD81FE1D2CC85B2DA504DBBAF23DDE8){target=_blank}

by Mikkel Traun, Principal Programmer, Novo Nordisk A/S

An MDR PoC solution was developed as part of the CDISC 360 project to illustrate how a study specification can be made using the concept-based standards. Concept-based standards are generalised data standard elements which correspond to how objectives, endpoints, activities and assessments are defined and scheduled in the study design. At Novo Nordisk, we are applying the learnings from the CDISC 360 PoC as inspiration to develop our next generation MDR and support the end-to-end process for clinical data standards.

This presentation will demonstrate how these goals can be achieved through a Study Builder App connected to a Study Metadata Repository and its linked graph database. This MDR solution is developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with a few vendors. Our ambition is to share this MDR solution as an open-source project and thereby contribute to improving data standards and tools supporting clinical development.
