## OpenStudyBuilder Community Meeting (virtual)

(05 May 2023 - 15:00-16:00 CEST, virtual event)

Everyone was invited to join our OpenStudyBuilder community meeting. After a short introduction we answered questions and showed areas people had been interested in. There was a huge interest in the CRF part including CRF related edit checks which could be added in the "Sponsor Extensions". Apart from the fact, that the ODM.XML can be exported, it is also possible to import ODM.XML - ideally you need to check that the codelists match the CDISC CTs, otherwise new sponsor specific codelists might be created. A nice note is that we are looking into the ICH M11 guideline about structured protocols. CDISC is looking into this guideline as well, so hopefully we can collaborate on this as well.


## CDISC Europe Interchange (Copenhagen, Denmark)

(26-27 April 2023, live event in Copenhagen)

We presented a poster on the OpenStudyBuilder and had nice demonstration sessions at the COSA booth. Furthermore there was a presentation by Marius
Conjeaud (Neo4j) and Nicolas de Saint Jorre (Novo Nordisk):

**All you wanted to know about Blood Pressure but were afraid to ask**

The presentation slides are available [here](./presentations/2023-04-27-Blood-Pressure.pdf){target=_blank}.

## COSA Biomedical Concept & OpenStudyBuilder Workshop (Copenhagen, Denmark)

(25 April 2023, Copenhagen, 9:00-15:00)

At this workshop we will dive into what Biomedical Concepts (BC) is, and how the can be applied within a MDR data standards repository and a SDR study definitions repository - illustrated within the OpenStudyBuilder (OSB) solution.

We will as well relate to how BC's are defined within COSMoS, DDF, d4k and other models. There will be a shared introduction followed by 4 breakout sessions, leading to a shared reflection and discussion on how we can support and bring these initiatives forward. The 4 breakout sessions are currently defined as:

- Breakout 1: Setup BC's in OSB SoA for a new study, run various queries to learn how BC's can be utilised
- Breakout 2: Learn and understand the BC model in OSB versus the COSMoS, DDF, d4k and other models
- Breakout 3: Create and curate OSB BC content and mining BC's from existing data sources like SDTM

**Summary:** We could get a good overview about the different initiatives related to Biomedical Concepts, what the differences are and possible ways forward. Specifically the high participation from CDISC and other experts in the BC field enabled excellent introductions, discussions and a fantastic collaborative opportunity. Thanks for all who joined the workshop.

## PHUSE EU Connect (Belfast)

(13-16 November 2022, live event in Belfast)

**Vision and demonstration of the OpenStudyBuilder for supporting structured protocol content and submission deliverables using concept-based standards**

by Martin Gram and Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S

OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome of the CDISC 360 project and as a Digital Data Flow (DDF) compliant solution. The vision is to make metadata driven study specifications based on concept-based standards to be applied in protocol development, downstream system setup and SDTM submission deliverables. It includes an MDR component for managing versioned external and sponsor-defined data standards. 

This poster will demonstrate the solution by:

- Showing how concept-based standards can be applied to define a study e.g., specifying objectives, endpoints, activities with reference to the study design schedule.
- Defining SDTM trial summary parameters, study arms, elements, epochs, and visit schedules.Creating structured protocol content directly from the repository.
 
OpenStudyBuilder is currently being developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with vendors. Our ambition is to share the solution as open source under COSA and thereby contribute to improvement of tools supporting digitalisation in clinical development.

**Talk to us**

Many used the opportunity to talk to us and see a brief demo. 

The poster is available [here](./presentations/2022-10-13-OpenStudyBuilder-PHUSE-SDE-Poster.pdf){target=_blank}.

## OpenStudyBuilder Q&A (virtual)

(07 November 2022 - 15:00-16:00 CET, virtual event)

**Join the open Q&A session to ask and discuss anything about the OpenStudyBuilder**

We had great talks similar to the first Q&A session. We had quick demonstration of various aspects of the OpenStudyBuilder and many discussions.

## CDISC US Interchange (Austin, Texas)

(26-27 October 2022, live event in Austin, TX)

**Concept-based standards in OpenStudyBuilder supporting structured protocol content and submission deliverables**

(27th October 2022 - Session 5: Track B - Trial Design - 8:30 - 9:00CT)

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S

OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome of the CDISC 360 project and as a Digital Data Flow (DDF) compliant solution. The vision is to make metadata driven study specifications based on concept-based standards to be applied in protocol development, downstream system setup and SDTM submission deliverables.

The solution includes an MDR component for managing versioned external and sponsor-defined data standards as concept based end-to-end standards linked from protocol specification, data collection to submission datasets. This presentation will focus on how we define and apply the concept based data standards.

OpenStudyBuilder is currently being developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with vendors. Our ambition is to share the solution as open source under COSA and thereby contribute to improvement of tools supporting digitalisation in clinical development.  

Slides including demonstration pictures are available [here](./presentations/2022-10-27-OpenStudyBuilderWithDemo-CDISC-US-Interchange.pdf){target=_blank}.

**CDISC Open Source Alliance Booth / COSA Booth**

There had be a high interest in demonstration and talks at the COSA booth around the OpenStudyBuilder. The next interchange will also have a booth and a time schedule, so use further chances for live demonstrations and direct talks!

## OpenStudyBuilder Q&A (virtual)

(24 October 2022 - 15:00-16:00 CEST, virtual event)

**Join the open Q&A session to ask and discuss anything about the OpenStudyBuilder**

We provided a quick overview of the OpenStudyBuilder (10') and the most important links - see [slides](./presentations/2022-10-24 OpenStudyBuilder - Q&A.pdf). The tool went live today on 24. October 2022 with the first version of the minimum viable product (MVP) in version 0.1. Then we started discussions around this tool. 

We have been discussing how the OpenStudyBuilder could be used to support also the pre-clinical phases. The SEND terminology is available in the OpenStudyBuilder. The trial summary datasets are very similar, but there is one additional dataset which could then be added at some point in time. The OpenStudyBuilder contains a lot, but many more things can and should be added. The OpenStudyBuilder is looking also for the pre-clinical area very valuable.

The terminologies have been shown during the meeting. A nice feature for terminologies is to view differences from one version to another. To load terminology updates to the system, currently an administrator running python commands is required. This is one functionality which should be enhanced in the future.

There are many things on the road map. Novo Nordisk is currently working on this as this is a missing part. When a decision on the roadmap has been performed by Novo Nordisk, this will be shared with the community as well. Collaborations enable additional priorities, so even though the core road map might priorize some items lower, a functionality might come earlier through collaboration.

The biomedical concept which is used can be browsed through the neo4j browser which is part of the sandbox environment and the local installation is very important and enables FAIR data. This is very powerful as concepts and contents are linked. This allows also later on to link and search specific information. Currently it is not planned to store the data as linked data. But that is likely on the roadmap far away.

We checked some examples for assessments and how there are stored in the OpenStudyBuilder. Also, the Protocol tool which is currently not open-source has been showed. This tool is running as a Word add-in using the APIs to get the required data. The API layer is very powerful as this enables data consumption and provision for any content.

A question about maintenance came up. As this is an open-source project it relies on the community to support general topics and issues. When there is a more detailed need for support, then it is recommended to use vendors commercially. The current contributors are lists and can easily be contacted. The OpenStudyBuilder would also be happy to include additional vendors to provide services around the OpenStudyBuilder. Novo Nordisk has no intention of being a software provider. The idea is to facilitate knowledge sharing and sharing these solutions among pharma companies. Then there could be a network of suppliers that can give you professional services around the use and installation and integrations and validations and so on.

A lot of documentation is available. The community documentation is this page here. Then we do have the repository documentation along with the source code in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Novo-Nordisk/nn-public/openstudybuilder/OpenStudyBuilder-Solution).. And finally, there is the in-build tool documentation which can be access by the local installation the "documentation" area or through the sandbox access where the documentation is available as well.


## PHUSE EMEA Autumn SDE (Copenhagen)

(13 October 2022, live event in Copenhagen)

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S, Katja Glass, Consultant and others

**Presentation: OpenStudyBuilder - Open Source MDR**

The OpenStudyBuilder is based on a proof of concept as part of the CDISC 360¬∞ project and is aiming to be a Transcelerate Digital Data Flow compliant implementation aiming for an end-to-end process. Metadata driven concept-based standards can ease our processes and tools. This presentation will show how we can benefit from working with connected metadata with the focus for SDTM and ADAM.

The OpenStudyBuilder is built by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with other vendors. It is (going to be) available as open source. This can become a game changer in our industry, as this will allow for full-scale collaborations that not only discuss processes and tools, but also share implementations, creating flexible and generic toolsets! By using standard APIs, e.g. those from the Transcelerate DDF project, a flexible, generic and interoperable tool landscape can be built.  Just like what we are used to from plug and play apps! 

The MDR as the heart, contains all the metadata and core study data information. The API allows many possible up and down stream integrations enabling system and data integrations. This includes the opportunity to create SAS macros or R functions to download information to the evaluation environments or even upload information.

## PHUSE EMEA SDE - Basel

(21 June 2022, live event in Basel)

by Katja Glass, Consultant (Community Manager for OpenStudyBuilder)

**OpenStudyBuilder - The Game Changer**

The OpenStudyBuilder is an open-source project run by NovoNordisk with the intention to support the future CDISC and DDF standards. It can become a game changer to enable the next step of collaboration together with common processes and workflows. Only when we share and discuss also tool implementations including supporting processes, we can build a common toolset and processes which we can use throughout our complete industry. This presentation will show a brief description of the OpenStudyBuilder tool and will show how we as industry can make use of it and design additional processes and tools as building blocks supported by a generic design, specific APIs and the will to change.

## GraphConnect 2022

(6-8 June 2022, live event in Austin, TX, USA)

by Marius CONJEAUD (NEO4J) and Nicolas DE SAINT JORRE (QUANTICSOFT / EVIDENTIQ)

**Creating a Clinical Knowledge Graph: Pharmaceutical Collaboration With OpenStudyBuilder**

OpenStudyBuilder is an open source project for clinical study evaluations. This tool is a new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes ‚Äì all the way from protocol development and CRF design ‚Äì to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities, and public disclosure of study information. Learn how we are building a complete solution based on a clinical knowledge graph that includes a shared API, a custom web application, and exploration tools to further analyze the data. We will also share the open source vision behind the project and how you can help! The OpenStudyBuilder, originally created by NovoNordisk, a global healthcare company, uses Neo4j as its database, along with other products from the Neo4j ecosystem, including NeoDash, Bloom, and the neomodel Python library. Neo4j's professional services team is also involved in the development and deployment of the solution.

## Graph Meetup Amsterdam

(12 May 2022, 18:00-20:00, live event in Amsterdam)

by Marius CONJEAUD (NEO4J) and Nicolas DE SAINT JORRE (QUANTICSOFT/ EVIDENTIQ)

**OpenStudyBuilder - "All you wanted to know about <del>Sex</del> Blood Pressure but were afraid to ask?"**

In this presentation we will demo this new OpenStudyBuilder application (in beta mode) starting from a very simple example:
"To demonstrate the superiority of Drug A relative to Drug B on Blood Pressure (BP)". This will lead us into the magic world of Nodes and Relationships to illustrate how this clinical objective can be "translated" into a linked graph, reducing the number of inconsistencies!

This presentation should illustrate how a concrete NEO4J professional application will help Clinical Research to bring a new drug to the market faster. You will see how this Graph database will allow us to produce related and consistent data to improve life on Earth!

## Presentation - Next Generation MDR Solution

**Next Generation MDR Solution for Study Design and Configuration Using Concept-based Standards**

*(15-19 November 2021 - PHUSE EU Connect)*

[Recording](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3434982/5FD81FE1D2CC85B2DA504DBBAF23DDE8){target=_blank} (needs EU Connect 2021 registration), [Slides](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3434982/5FD81FE1D2CC85B2DA504DBBAF23DDE8){target=_blank}

by Mikkel Traun, Principal Programmer, Novo Nordisk A/S

An MDR PoC solution was developed as part of the CDISC 360 project to illustrate how a study specification can be made using the concept-based standards. Concept-based standards are generalised data standard elements which correspond to how objectives, endpoints, activities and assessments are defined and scheduled in the study design. At Novo Nordisk, we are applying the learnings from the CDISC 360 PoC as inspiration to develop our next generation MDR and support the end-to-end process for clinical data standards.

This presentation will demonstrate how these goals can be achieved through a Study Builder App connected to a Study Metadata Repository and its linked graph database. This MDR solution is developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with a few vendors. Our ambition is to share this MDR solution as an open-source project and thereby contribute to improving data standards and tools supporting clinical development.
