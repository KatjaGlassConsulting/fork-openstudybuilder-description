## DDF Connectathon

(September 2022, virtual 3-week-event)

**DDF Showcase**

We are planning to join the DDF Connectathon with an OpenStudyBuilder show case. Planning is ongoing.

## PHUSE EMEA Autumn SDE (Copenhagen)

(13 October 2022, live event in Copenhagen)

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S, Katja Glass, Consultant and others

**Theme: Experience with Exploring and Using Open-source Software**

The theme for this single day event is on open source projects where the OpenStudyBuilder will have a presentation. The SDE is additionally planning for a panel discussion. Currently additionally a poster session and an open space for direct discussions is planned.

A detailed description, the agenda when available and the registration about 6 weeks prior to the event is available [here](https://www.eventsforce.net/attend/frontend/reg/tOtherPage.csp?pageID=8559&eventID=15&traceRedir=2){target=_blank}.

**Presentation: OpenStudyBuilder - Open Source MDR**

The OpenStudyBuilder is based on a proof of concept as part of the CDISC 360Â° project and is aiming to be a Transcelerate Digital Data Flow compliant implementation aiming for an end-to-end process. Metadata driven concept-based standards can ease our processes and tools. This presentation will show how we can benefit from working with connected metadata with the focus for SDTM and ADAM.

The OpenStudyBuilder is built by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with other vendors. It is (going to be) available as open source. This can become a game changer in our industry, as this will allow for full-scale collaborations that not only discuss processes and tools, but also share implementations, creating flexible and generic toolsets! By using standard APIs, e.g. those from the Transcelerate DDF project, a flexible, generic and interoperable tool landscape can be built.  Just like what we are used to from plug and play apps! 

The MDR as the heart, contains all the metadata and core study data information. The API allows many possible up and down stream integrations enabling system and data integrations. This includes the opportunity to create SAS macros or R functions to download information to the evaluation environments or even upload information.


## CDISC US Interchange (Austin, Texas)

(26-27 October 2022, live event in Austin, TX)

**Concept-based standards in OpenStudyBuilder supporting structured protocol content and submission deliverables**

(27th October 2022 - Session 5: Track B - Trial Design - 8:30 - 9:00CT)

by Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S

OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome of the CDISC 360 project and as a Digital Data Flow (DDF) compliant solution. The vision is to make metadata driven study specifications based on concept-based standards to be applied in protocol development, downstream system setup and SDTM submission deliverables.

The solution includes an MDR component for managing versioned external and sponsor-defined data standards as concept based end-to-end standards linked from protocol specification, data collection to submission datasets. This presentation will focus on how we define and apply the concept based data standards.

OpenStudyBuilder is currently being developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with vendors. Our ambition is to share the solution as open source under COSA and thereby contribute to improvement of tools supporting digitalisation in clinical development.  

**CDISC Open Source Alliance Booth / COSA Booth**

Watch out for demonstrations of the OpenStudyBuilder and come around to ask questions and learn more! Among other tools and topics which are presented and talked about at the COSA booth, also the OpenStudyBuilder is on board!

## PHUSE EU Connect (Belfast)

(13-16 November 2022, live event in Belfast)

Registration and additional conference information [here](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=8190&eventID=16){target=_blank}.

**Vision and demonstration of the OpenStudyBuilder for supporting structured protocol content and submission deliverables using concept-based standards**

by Martin Gram and Mikkel Traun, Novo Nordisk A/S

OpenStudyBuilder is developed as an outcome of the CDISC 360 project and as a Digital Data Flow (DDF) compliant solution. The vision is to make metadata driven study specifications based on concept-based standards to be applied in protocol development, downstream system setup and SDTM submission deliverables. It includes an MDR component for managing versioned external and sponsor-defined data standards. 

This presentation will demonstrate the solution by:

- Showing how concept-based standards can be applied to define a study e.g., specifying objectives, endpoints, activities with reference to the study design schedule.
- Defining SDTM trial summary parameters, study arms, elements, epochs, and visit schedules.Creating structured protocol content directly from the repository.
 
OpenStudyBuilder is currently being developed by Novo Nordisk in collaboration with vendors. Our ambition is to share the solution as open source under COSA and thereby contribute to improvement of tools supporting digitalisation in clinical development.

**Talk to us**

Please use also the networking opportunities to talk about possible collaborations and challenges of the OpenStudyBuilder with us.
