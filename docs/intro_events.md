## Graph Meetup Amsterdam

(12 May 2022, 18:00-20:00, live event in Amsterdam)

by Marius CONJEAUD (NEO4J) and Nicolas DE SAINT JORRE (QUANTICSOFT/ EVIDENTIQ)

**OpenStudyBuilder - "All you wanted to know about <del>Sex</del> Blood Pressure but were afraid to ask?"**

In this presentation we will demo this new OpenStudyBuilder application (in beta mode) starting from a very simple example:
"To demonstrate the superiority of Drug A relative to Drug B on Blood Pressure (BP)". This will lead us into the magic world of Nodes and Relationships to illustrate how this clinical objective can be "translated" into a linked graph, reducing the number of inconsistencies!

This presentation should illustrate how a concrete NEO4J professional application will help Clinical Research to bring a new drug to the market faster. You will see how this Graph database will allow us to produce related and consistent data to improve life on Earth!
