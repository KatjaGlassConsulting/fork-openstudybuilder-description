## Graph Meetup Amsterdam

(12 May 2022, 18:00-20:00, live event in Amsterdam)

by Marius CONJEAUD (NEO4J) and Nicolas DE SAINT JORRE (QUANTICSOFT/ EVIDENTIQ)

**OpenStudyBuilder - "All you wanted to know about <del>Sex</del> Blood Pressure but were afraid to ask?"**

You can register for this live event [here](https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-netherlands/events/285410610/).

In this presentation we will demo this new OpenStudyBuilder application (in beta mode) starting from a very simple example:
"To demonstrate the superiority of Drug A relative to Drug B on Blood Pressure (BP)". This will lead us into the magic world of Nodes and Relationships to illustrate how this clinical objective can be "translated" into a linked graph, reducing the number of inconsistencies!

This presentation should illustrate how a concrete NEO4J professional application will help Clinical Research to bring a new drug to the market faster. You will see how this Graph database will allow us to produce related and consistent data to improve life on Earth!

## GraphConnect 2022 (Austin, TX, USA)

(6-8 June 2022, live event in Austin, TX, USA)

by Marius CONJEAUD (NEO4J) and Nicolas DE SAINT JORRE (QUANTICSOFT / EVIDENTIQ)

**Creating a Clinical Knowledge Graph: Pharmaceutical Collaboration With OpenStudyBuilder**

You can register for this live event [here](https://www.graphconnect.com/agenda).

OpenStudyBuilder is an open source project for clinical study evaluations. This tool is a new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes – all the way from protocol development and CRF design – to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities, and public disclosure of study information. Learn how we are building a complete solution based on a clinical knowledge graph that includes a shared API, a custom web application, and exploration tools to further analyze the data. We will also share the open source vision behind the project and how you can help! The OpenStudyBuilder, originally created by NovoNordisk, a global healthcare company, uses Neo4j as its database, along with other products from the Neo4j ecosystem, including NeoDash, Bloom, and the neomodel Python library. Neo4j's professional services team is also involved in the development and deployment of the solution.

## PHUSE EMEA SDE (Basel)

The following abstract has been submitted to be presented. As the final agenda is not planned yet, it might be that this presentation will not be available.

**OpenStudyBuilder - The Game Changer**

The OpenStudyBuilder is an open-source project run by NovoNordisk with the intention to support the future CDISC and DDF standards. It can become a game changer to enable the next step of collaboration together with common processes and workflows. Only when we share and discuss also tool implementations including supporting processes, we can build a common toolset and processes which we can use throughout our complete industry.

This presentation will show a brief description of the OpenStudyBuilder tool and will show how we as industry can make use of it and design additional processes and tools as building blocks supported by a generic design, specific APIs and the will to change.
